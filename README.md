I wrote this project under the supervision of Dr Erliang in the University of South Dakota, this project is used to test the performance of popular classifiers in multi-class data with small samples. I implemented three popular classifiers (SVM,Naive Bayes, Random Forest) in python using machine learning library scikit-learn and analysed their performances using popular IRIS data. I reprensed the performances using ROC curve for comparision.If you are intereted in more details, please read my poster in this repository or contact me, my email is luzhixiu1996@gmail.com.
